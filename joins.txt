Map Join --> Map join is another type of join in hive,also called as Auto map join
             Regular join in hive uses too much activity spending on shuffling the data,it slows down hive queries.
	     Join could perform within a mapper without using map and reduce.
	    *If one of the tables in the join is small table,it loaded into the memory.

 Step 1: it creates local map reduce task before it creats a orignal map reduce task
 Step 2: this map reduce task read data of small table and save it into the in-memory hash table,then to hash table file

 Step 3: when original map reduce task started,it moves to hdfs distrubuted cache,it will populate each mapper-local disk
 Step 4: then it will perform join operation in map phase


Config:  set hive.auto.convert.join=true;
set hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize = 30000000;
